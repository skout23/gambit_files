Public files I have helped create or find useful.
All files are in the public domain.  Do with them what you like, I ask you 
give credit if they help you out.  But I don't really care.

File List:

FixedWidthFontGmail.user.js	Do I really need to describe this one?
DoxygenConfig.default		A verbose defaul Doxygen config file
